  // Place your snippets for JavaScript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Print to console": {
    "prefix": "clog",
    "body": ["console.log($0)"],
    "description": "Log to console"
  },
  "Print JSON to console": {
    "prefix": "jlog",
    "body": ["console.log(JSON.stringify($0, null, 2))"],
    "description": "Log JSON to console"
  },
}
